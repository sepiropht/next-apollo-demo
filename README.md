## Features done

- [x] Fork the repo: https://github.com/arunoda/next-apollo-demo This is a basic app using Next.js & Apollo GraphQL.
- [x] We would like you to update Next.js, React, Apollo GraphQL to the latest versions.
- [x] Refactor the code as deemed fit. Brownie points if you use some of the latest features of react like Hooks, Suspense Lazy etc. More brownie points if you use TypeScript.
- [x] Create a New Page in Nextjs where you display these names and addresses as a grid of card tiles. The page needs to be responsive.
- [x] Add a type ahead search that allows me the search/ filter the list by typing the first 3-4 characters of a name.
- [ ] Add the necessary security features to protect the site from things like XSS, Clickjacking etc.

- [ ] Implement Lazyloading / Infinite scrolls so that you load 20 cards each time you click a ‘Load More’ button, which you would need to create.
- [ ] Add Unit Tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

- [x] Dockerize the server and client app and use docker-compose so that we can run the app locally using docker-compose.
- [x] Deploy your App on Heroku. And send us a link to the app.
- [ ] Write cypress end to end test for the page you created.
